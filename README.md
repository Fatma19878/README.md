## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
Library Integration: Integrating external libraries, in this case, countryinfo, involves understanding the library's documentation, installation procedures, and learning how to use its functionalities to extract country information.
User Input Handling: Handling user input requires careful validation and error handling. Consider implementing input checks to ensure the program can gracefully handle unexpected inputs.

Library Limitations: Depending on the library being used, you might encounter limitations or unexpected behaviors. Checking the library's GitHub repository or forums can help identify and address these issues.

Testing: Testing can be challenging, especially when relying on external APIs or libraries that fetch data from the internet. Creating mock tests or using unit testing techniques can help validate the program's functionality.
